Have fun with it and if you want to learn more about ThousandEyes dashboards check out our Getting Stared with Dashboards documenation.</p> <p>Outside of the scope of this but a best practice recommendation is to set up alert rules with suitable conditions and assign those to your tests associated with your Endpoint Agents. This ensures you are notified of potential issues as soon as they occur, allowing for a swift resolution before user impact. For instance, if an Endpoint Agent detects a network connection issue, it can send an alert to your IT team. They can then investigate and resolve the issue before it starts affecting users. Alert rules can be configured to monitor performance metrics such as latency, packet loss, and jitter, or to flag when an application becomes unavailable or experiences degraded performance.</p> <p>You can choose to receive these alerts when certain thresholds are exceeded and have them directed to a tool of your preference. ThousandEyes supports numerous integration options, including native integrations with Webex and ITSM tools such as ServiceNow and PagerDuty. Alternatively, you can choose from various custom webhook templates such as Webex, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or any third-party tool of your choice using the generic template. ThousandEyes integrations are powerful, delivering alerts directly into your existing workflow, thereby centralizing data and notifications from multiple sources into a single platform.
